# A datasheet for Pokemon GO
A silly little side-project I started one night to help me better organize my pokemon go data

This repo is associated directly with a public Google Sheets spreadsheet and it is my intention to keep the data synchronized and up-to-date.
It would probably be more intelligent to create the data on Github and then import it and decorate it on Sheets, but whatever.
